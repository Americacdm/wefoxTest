|Stress Testing: to simulate massive accesses, increasing the number of searches every 10,000 accesses to evaluate the launch of a new product.|Know the maximum volume of transactions in the face of a number of unexpected purchases.|Those are often expensive tests if you want to increase reliability, as high hardware availability may be required|
